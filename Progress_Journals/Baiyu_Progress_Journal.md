## Week 1

Since my team has decided to build our data from scratch by downloading and cleaning multiple years of March Madness game data, we have had our work cut out for ourselves. The NCAA website offers 18 categories of team statistics for each of the past 12 seasons. Due to the presence of large amounts of game data, we have decided to split the downloading amongst the 4 of us by having each of us downloading the data files of 3 game seasons. Although there were many categories of statistical data included in the data files, we have decided to focus on the categorical rankings of the teams because we conclude it would be the most direct and least complex data set to measure each teams performance in the season. By placing our focus on the ranking data, such as the number of turnovers, we are then able to standardize our datasets and use them meaningfully in our machine learning model training. The compiling of the files of all seasons has made our final datasets relatively large. Nonetheless, by making a direct correlation between each categorical rankings and the number of wins, we in theory could make a prediction model based on the relationship between these data sets and predict which team would have the best chance to come on top in this tournament.


## Week 2

In this week, our team has began to use the compiled data for machine learning model training. We have run Liner and logistic regression in Jupyter and R, and we have concluded as a result that our data
