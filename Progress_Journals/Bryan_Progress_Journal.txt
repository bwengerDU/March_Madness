## Week 1

Since we have decided to build our data from scratch we have confined ourselves to having a large amount of work dedicated to basic data set up. This process has been very beneficial though. The NCAA website offers 18 categories of team statistics for each of the past 12 seasons. We broke down the years amongst the four of us to compile the data for each year into one single file. Within each of the statistic categories there were a multitude of measures used, but we decided that the most important factor was to capture how the teams Ranked for each category. By using the rankings instead of the raw statistic performance, like the number of Assists Per Game, is that it would standardize the data across all the categories and we would be able to account for any significant changes in rules that would impact the pure number of each performance, when what matters more is how a particular team performs compared to its competitors. Once this list is complete for each year we had to insert the performance of teams in the March Madness tournament. Of the roughly 350 teams in the NCAA, only 64 make it to the tournament. The success of a team in the tournament is measured by how many wins they achieved in the tournament. 32 teams would have 0 wins and were eliminated from the tournament. The eventual champion would have a total of 6 wins, while the runner-up would have 5. Our ultimate goal is to determine which statistical categories had correlation to the amount of wins in the tournament. Once correlations can be established we’d be able to apply this to predicting a team’s potential to win games in the tournament based upon how well they performed in those key statistical areas during the regular season. 

## Week 2

This week’s work has been more about adjusting expectations. We have run multiple linear regression in R, linear regression in Jupyter . Analysis has shown that having our output target as tournament wins has created a significant imbalance in our data set that has significantly skewed our results. Every season we have only 32 teams with at least 1 win in the tournament and over 330 teams with 0 wins. Having the data break down in roughly a 10-to-1 ratio significantly skews the data so that we are highly accurate in predictions because we are very good at predicting 0 wins, which comprises 90% of the data. However, this is the least important piece of what we are trying to accomplish, because tournament wins is what predicts the bracket. We first whittled down the list to only include teams that reached the March Madness tournament as opposed to including all teams. This created a data set that would have 32 teams with 0 wins and 16 with 1 win, 8 with 2 wins, 4 with 3 wins, 2 with 4 wins, 1 with 5 wins, and 1 with 6 wins. This did significantly improve our results in predicting wins, but it still has skewed towards predicting the 1 game winners, while struggling to identify any 6 game winners. We decided that in order to minimize the influence of diminishing Win results would be to create a binary outcome for each bracket layer in which the first layer would distinguish teams with 0 wins as a 0 and those with one or more win as a 1. In layer two we remove those previous 0 binary scores and from this new, reduced pool we distinguish teams that have 1 win as 0 and those with 2 or more as 1. We continue this process down until we reach our final 7th bucket of teams to predict teams for 6 wins.
